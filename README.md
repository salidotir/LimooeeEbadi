## E-MALL (E-Mobility for All)

In this project, we are going to create two main documents RASD & DD for the E-Mall.

* RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document):
  - Contains goals, requirements and assumptions

* DD (Design Document)
  - contains more details in designing and implementing the interfaces and components of the project


## Abstract

> Users & Systems
> * EV-drivers --> User
> * Electric mobility service provider (eMSP) --> System
> * Charging point operators (CPOs) --> User
> * Charging point management systems (CPMS) --> System
> * Distribution System Operators (DSOs) --> External System


> The complete use case considered fro doing the project:
> - A new EV-driver signs up in the eMSP system.
> - EV-driver logins to the system.
> - EV-driver searches for charging point stations (nearby, lowest price, highest rate, socket type, and etc.) in eMSP system.
> - EV-driver books a socket 20 minutes before connection in a charging point.
> - eMSP notifies CPMS about the new booking and gives confirmation receipt to EV driver.
> - Charging process is started by connecting the vehicle to the socket.
> - eMSP notifies EV-driver when charging process is finished.
> - EV-driver pays for the service either from internal wallet credit or using credit card.
> - EV-driver rates the charging station.
